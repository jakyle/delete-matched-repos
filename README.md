# DELETE OLD REPOS

simply create a .env file and add all the environment variables required in main.rs

... also install rust

I created this because I had a bunch of repos that I forked from while I was a teacher assistant at a coding boot camp in Detriot MI. so I had hundreds of repos to my name.
